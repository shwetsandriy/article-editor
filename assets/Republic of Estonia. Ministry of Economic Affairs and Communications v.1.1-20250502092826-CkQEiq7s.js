The Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MEAC) has been at the forefront of digital innovation, driving projects that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time economy (RTE) principles to enhance public services and economic efficiency. These initiatives align with the broader goals outlined in the Estonian Digital Agenda 2030, which aims to advance Estonia's economy, state, and society through digital technology over the next decade[\\[1\\]](https://mkm.ee/en/e-state-and-connectivity/digital-agenda-2030).

  

One of the notable projects is the collaboration with Microsoft, formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2021. This partnership aims to leverage cloud computing and AI to modernize government infrastructure and improve public services. A key initiative under this collaboration is the #krattAI project, which enables citizens to interact with public services using virtual assistants that understand and respond in fluent Estonian [\\[2\\]](https://mkm.ee/en/news/government-estonia-signs-memorandum-understanding-microsoft).

  

In addition to AI projects, MEAC has been actively involved in promoting the real-time economy. The ministry's efforts are highlighted in the "State of Play" report, which assesses Estonia's readiness to implement AI solutions in public services and the current state of digital public services for enterprises. This report is part of a broader project funded by the European Union to support the productivity and competitiveness of Estonian SMEs through real-time economy and digital solutions [\\[3\\]](https://mkm.ee/sites/default/files/documents/2023-06/State%20of%20Play_The%20Provision%20of%20Digital%20Public%20Services%20to%20Enterprises%20in%20Estonia%20and%20Preparedness%20to%20AI%20solutions.pdf).

  

The Real-Time Economy (RTE) initiative, supported by MEAC, focuses on eliminating unproductive work by enabling the real-time exchange of high-quality data between businesses, citizens, and the state. This initiative aims to streamline processes and improve efficiency across various sectors [\\[4\\]](https://realtimeeconomy-bsr.eu/).

  

**AI-Powered Documentation: Estonia's AI-Driven MemoAI Project**

Building on these digital transformation efforts, the Ministry is exploring innovative solutions like MemoAI, an AI-based software designed to automatically generate memos from previous memos and data. This pilot project, proposed by DevRain, aims to enhance productivity and streamline documentation processes within the Ministry. DevRain, a Microsoft AI Cloud Solutions Partner, brings its expertise in AI and cloud solutions to this project, ensuring robust and scalable implementation.

  

MemoAI operates by allowing users to input key information such as the topic, context, and optional instructions. The system then generates an initial version of the document following a predefined template. Users can provide feedback, and the system will regenerate the document accordingly. Once the user approves the final document, it can be downloaded in various formats, including Word, TXT, PDF, PPTX, and HTML.

  

The solution supports both Estonian and English languages for the user interface and output documents. It focuses on text-only outputs, ignoring images to maintain simplicity and efficiency. Key scenarios include Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and document generation, with all user and bot interactions saved to a database for review purposes.

  

The architecture of MemoAI leverages Azure OpenAI Service, Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, and other Azure components to ensure robust performance and scalability.
