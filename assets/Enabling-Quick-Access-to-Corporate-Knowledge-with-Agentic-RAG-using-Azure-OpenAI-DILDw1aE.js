const n=`# Enabling Quick Access to Corporate Knowledge with Agentic RAG using Azure OpenAI  

In this case study, we explore how the company leveraged Azure services and the innovative Agents and 'ChatGPT on Your Data' approach, incorporating Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to manage and utilize a vast collection of documents effectively and handle user queries. This solution significantly streamlined information retrieval, reducing dependency on support specialists and enhancing their efficiency in addressing requests.Â 

### Problem

The company has many documents in multiple formats (PDF, Word, Excel) and documentation in external systems (Zendesk, etc.) about the Platform and would like to allow employees & clients to use these documents as a knowledge base (KB). Also, users must generate Powershell scripts and Kusto queries to retrieve data from the Platform.

  


### Solution

Users can quickly access information from the company knowledge base (KB) and receive exact answers to their questions without using extensive search. KB is configurable by administrators and allows users to specify their permissions for data access.
