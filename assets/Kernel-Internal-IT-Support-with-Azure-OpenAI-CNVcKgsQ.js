**Key Components:**

1. Azure OpenAI: Advanced language model for natural conversation

2. Agentic RAG: Technique to enhance AI responses with the retrieved information

3. Data Sources:

 - Confluence: company internal knowledge base

 - Jira: issue tracking and project management

 - SharePoint Online: internal documents - technical manuals and guides

  


**Implementation**

1. Data Indexing: content from Confluence, Jira, and documents was processed and indexed to AI knowledge base. Documents (PDF, Word etc) are processed with Azure Document Intelligence to retrieve content.

2. RAG Integration: the system was set up to retrieve relevant information from AI knowledge base and use Azure OpenAI to answer user queries. The system provides citations so users can validate the correctness of the answers and check details if needed.

3. Real-time updates from Jira, Confluence, and SharePoint are being processed, and AI knowledge base was updated. 

  


JIRA and Confluence: REST API is used. To receive real-time updates - Webhooks.

SharePoint Online: Microsoft Graph API is used. To receive real-time updates - SharePoint Online Webhooks.

  


**Conclusion**

By combining Azure OpenAI with agentic RAG and leveraging existing knowledge bases, Kernel improved its customer support efficiency and effectiveness, improved employee and customer satisfaction, and reduced costs.
