### About

Cloud SaaS platform for competency, compliance, permissions, and management for SMBs and enterprises.

  

### **Challenge**

The company needed help validating the business idea with an MVP, building the platform, and delivering the solution to end clients.

  

### Solution

DevRain helped define the MVP scope, build the MVP, and validate it with the first clients. After the MVP was validated, we identified the product scope for version 1.0 and helped deliver it to the clients. This collaboration is still in progress, and we are helping to evolve the product and set up integration with enterprise clients with custom security and data governance requirements.

*   Specifications and PoC
